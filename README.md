Welcome! This is a webgl build of a character action controller I'm developing in Unity.

With this project I hope to create a basic general character action controller template for use in future Unity projects.

Demo Link: https://spicygarlicalbacoreroll.github.io/characterActionControllerDemo/index.html

Controls:
  WASD Controls for movement
  Mouse for camera control
  Spacebar to jump and Double Jump
  R to reset position

The end goal is . . .

  - Fast and snappy movement
  
  - Double Jumps
  
  - Wall Jumps
  
  - Dashes
  
  - Hit and Hurt boxes

  - Streamlined method of developing flashy combos (Ex: Metal Gear Rising Revengeance, Bayonetta, Neir Automata, Devil May Cry)
