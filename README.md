LATEST BUILD: Version 0.2
  RELEASE DATE: 4/8/19
  
Welcome! This is a webgl build of a character action controller I'm developing in Unity.
With this project I hope to create a basic general character action controller template for use in future Unity projects.

Demo Link: https://spicygarlicalbacoreroll.github.io/characterActionControllerDemo/index.html

Controls: (Not sure if XBOX ONE controllers supported in browser)
  MOVEMENT: WASD Controls / Left Joystick
  JUMP/DOUBLEJUMP:  Spacebar/A
  DASH:     Hold LEFT SHIFT while moving in direction (has couple second cooldown)
  CAMERA:   Mouse / Right Joystick  (press M to toggle between them)
  RESET POSITION:   R
The end goal is . . .

  - Fast and snappy movement
  
  - Double Jumps
  
  - Wall Jumps
  
  - Dashes
  
  - Hit and Hurt boxes

  - Streamlined method of developing flashy combos (Ex: Metal Gear Rising Revengeance, Bayonetta, Neir Automata, Devil May Cry)
